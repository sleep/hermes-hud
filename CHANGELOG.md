# Changelog

All notable changes to Hermes HUD are documented here.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Auto-Refresh

The HUD previously required pressing `r` to refresh. It now supports an optional auto-refresh timer controlled by the `HERMES_HUD_REFRESH` environment variable.

**What's new:**

- **Auto-refresh timer** — set `HERMES_HUD_REFRESH` to a positive number of seconds and the dashboard will refresh automatically
- **Boot-screen safe** — auto-refresh waits until you leave the boot animation before it starts reloading data
- **Status indicator** — when auto-refresh is enabled, the footer status line shows the interval

**Files changed:**
- `hermes_hud/hud.py` — env var parsing, timer setup, `_auto_refresh` callback, status line
- `README.md` — documented `HERMES_HUD_REFRESH`
- `tests/test_integration.py` — coverage for default, valid, and invalid env var values

### Kiosk / Status-Display Mode

A new `--auto` flag turns the HUD into a hands-free status display. It skips the boot animation, immediately loads data, and starts timers that page-scroll through the current tab and rotate to the next tab. Useful for leaving on a dedicated monitor.

**What's new:**

- **`--auto` CLI flag** — enables kiosk mode
- **Auto-scroll** — pages down the active tab every `HERMES_HUD_AUTO_SCROLL` seconds (default: 3)
- **Auto-tab rotation** — switches to the next data tab every `HERMES_HUD_AUTO_TAB` seconds (default: 20); cycles through dashboard, cron, projects, health, corrections, agents, profiles, and patterns
- **Boot animation skipped** — loads the dashboard immediately so the display starts showing data
- **Status indicator** — footer shows scroll/tab intervals when active

**Files changed:**
- `hermes_hud/hud.py` — `--auto` parsing, `_boot_into_auto_mode`, `_auto_scroll`, `_auto_next_tab`, status line
- `README.md` — documented `--auto` and kiosk env vars
- `tests/test_integration.py` — coverage for `--auto` flag and env var overrides

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-06

### Prompt Patterns Tab

The HUD could show you *what* the agent did — sessions, tools, memory — but never *how you use it*. The new Patterns tab (press `9`) analyzes your session history and surfaces actionable self-improvement insights.

**What's new:**

- **Task clustering** — classifies every session by first user message into categories (git ops, debugging, code gen, refactor, research, config/ops, docs) with bar chart and percentages
- **Repeated request detection** — normalizes and groups first prompts across sessions; flags patterns seen 3+ times as skill candidates with a yellow bolt icon
- **Peak hours** — 24-hour sparkline showing when you're most active, with peak hour callout
- **Common tool chains** — extracts the most frequent 3-tool sequences across all sessions (e.g., Read → Edit → Bash)

**Also in this release:**

- **Hardcoded values eliminated** — memory limits in `profiles.py` now import from `memory.py` constants; snapshot dir respects `HERMES_HOME`; health panel critical keys are provider-aware; capacity bar thresholds unified across all widgets
- **Health auto-discovery** — API keys/tokens found in `.env` that aren't in the expected list are now surfaced automatically
- **Agent process list expanded** — aider, cursor, windsurf added to scanned processes
- **Alias detection** — checks both `~/.local/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` (was Linux-only)

**Files added:**
- `hermes_hud/collectors/patterns.py` — queries sessions + messages tables with window function JOIN, single DB connection for all 4 analytics
- `hermes_hud/widgets/patterns_panel.py` — Rich markup display with sparklines, bar charts, and skill candidate flags

**Files changed:**
- `hermes_hud/models.py` — `PatternsState`, `TaskCluster`, `RepeatedPrompt`, `HourlyActivity`, `ToolWorkflow` dataclasses
- `hermes_hud/hud.py` — tab 9 wired with CSS, keybinding, parallel collector
- `hermes_hud/collectors/health.py` — auto-discover extra API keys from .env
- `hermes_hud/widgets/health_panel.py` — provider-aware critical key detection
- `hermes_hud/collectors/profiles.py` — import memory constants, cross-platform alias detection
- `hermes_hud/widgets/overview.py`, `profiles_panel.py` — shared capacity bar thresholds
- `hermes_hud/snapshot.py` — respects `HERMES_HOME` for snapshot dir
- `hermes_hud/widgets/__init__.py` — `CAPACITY_RED_PCT`, `CAPACITY_YELLOW_PCT` constants

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-05

### tmux Operator View

Agents running inside tmux were invisible to the HUD — you knew a process was alive but had no idea which pane it lived in or whether it needed your attention. The Agents tab now functions as a live operator panel for Ghostty + tmux workflows.

**What's new:**

- **Pane discovery** — detects all tmux panes across sessions with session/window/pane identity
- **Process mapping** — matches live agent processes to panes via TTY (one batch `ps` call for all PIDs)
- **Jump hints** — each live agent line shows `→ session:window.pane` when matched
- **Operator queue** — scans matched pane output for approval prompts, questions, errors, and stuck states; surfaces them in a color-coded queue at the top of the Agents tab
- **Pane preview section** — unmatched panes running non-shell commands shown with coordinates
- **macOS support** — `_get_process_info` now dispatches by platform; macOS variant uses `ps` + `lsof` instead of `/proc`
- **Graceful fallback** — all tmux code degrades silently when tmux is not installed or no server is running
- **Parallel capture** — pane preview reads run concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`

**Files changed:**
- `hermes_hud/collectors/agents.py` — `TmuxPane`, `OperatorAlert` dataclasses; `matched_pane_count`, `unmatched_interesting_panes`, `has_tmux` on `AgentsState`; 10 new helper functions
- `hermes_hud/widgets/agents_panel.py` — operator queue section, jump hints, unmatched panes section
- `tests/test_tmux.py` — 45 new tests (tmux parsing, TTY matching, alert detection, macOS etime)
- `tests/test_collectors.py` — assertions for new `AgentsState` fields

**Test count:** 142 (was 97)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-04

### Profiles Tab

Hermes supports multiple agent profiles — isolated instances with their own model, memory, skills, and gateway. Until now there was no way to see them side by side. The new Profiles tab (press `8`) shows every profile on your system with full stats.

**Per-profile data:**
- Model, provider, backend URL, port, context length
- Session count, message count, tool calls, token usage (input/output/total)
- Last active timestamp
- Memory and user profile capacity bars with entry counts
- Skill count, cron job count
- Toolsets enabled
- SOUL.md personality summary (first line)
- Compression config (model + enabled status)
- API key names from `.env` (names only, never values)
- Gateway status (systemd service check)
- Server status (health endpoint check for local llama-server)
- CLI alias detection (`~/.local/bin/<name>`)
- Local vs API classification

**Files added:**
- `hermes_hud/collectors/profiles.py` — scans `~/.hermes/` (default profile) and `~/.hermes/profiles/*/` (custom profiles)
- `hermes_hud/widgets/profiles_panel.py` — card-style Rich markup display with capacity bars and status dots
- `tests/test_profiles.py` — 18 tests against fake profile fixtures

**Also:**
- `ProfileInfo` and `ProfilesState` dataclasses in `models.py`
- Tab 8 wired into `hud.py` with CSS, keybinding, and lazy-load
- Fake "social" profile added to test fixtures in `conftest.py`
- Import checks updated for new modules
- 97 tests pass (was 79)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-01

### The Problem

v0.1 worked as a personal Hermes dashboard, but getting it running on anyone else's machine required local fixes. Hardcoded `python3.11` shebangs broke on 3.12/3.13. A bash launcher needed manual symlinking. `~/projects` and `~/.hermes` were baked in with no overrides. Blank panels gave no guidance when Hermes data was missing. No test suite meant contributors couldn't verify their changes.

### What Changed

**Proper pip-installable package**
All code restructured from flat scripts into a `hermes_hud/` Python package with relative imports. `pip install -e .` registers the `hermes-hud` command automatically. No symlinks, no `sys.path` hacks, no bash launcher.

**Any Python 3.11+**
Removed all 9 hardcoded `python3.11` shebangs. Works with 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 — whatever you have installed.

**Environment variable support**
- `HERMES_HOME` — point to any agent data directory (default: `~/.hermes`)
- `HERMES_HUD_PROJECTS_DIR` — point to any projects directory (default: `~/projects`)
- Both documented in `hermes-hud --help`

**First-run guidance**
If `~/.hermes/` doesn't exist, the HUD prints a clear message explaining what's needed instead of showing empty panels.

**Test suite — 79 tests**
- `test_imports.py` — All 35 modules import cleanly, no `sys.path` hacks, no hardcoded shebangs
- `test_env_vars.py` — `HERMES_HOME` and `HERMES_HUD_PROJECTS_DIR` priority chains (arg > env > default)
- `test_collectors.py` — Every collector runs against fake data, returns correct types, handles missing data gracefully
- `test_integration.py` — Full `collect_all()` pipeline, snapshot save/load/diff cycle, app instantiation, CLI flags, dataclass models

**Developer experience**
- Makefile with `make install`, `make dev`, `make clean`, `make test`
- Setup docs now explicitly call out creating the venv with Python 3.11+ on systems where `python3` is still 3.10
- Contributing docs now use the installed `hermes-hud` command instead of a nonexistent `./hermes-hud` script
- `pyfiglet` moved to optional `[neofetch]` extra
- Updated CLAUDE.md for the new package structure

**Snapshot storage**
- Fixed snapshot save/load path handling so tests and alternate snapshot directories resolve the current target file correctly

### Installation (before → after)

Before:
```bash
git clone ...
cd hermes-hud
pip install -r requirements.txt
# manually symlink the launcher to ~/.local/bin/
# hope you have python3.11 specifically
```

After:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeynyc/hermes-hud.git
cd hermes-hud
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
hermes-hud
```
